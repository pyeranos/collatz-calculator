# collatz-calculator

Yet another collatz calculator. This was made for comparing sequences. There is no information concerning sequence length. Runs can be sorted. And you can save a run for comparison with another run for similarities. The largest term in the run is marked with a disk. All terms divisible by 3 are in blue. When run backwards, sequences usually end in terms divisible by 3. I have made it so that such terms are displayed but do not terminate the run. The run is terminated at the term highlighted in red.
